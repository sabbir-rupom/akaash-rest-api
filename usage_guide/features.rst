Project Features
################

This project does not include much features, but I have tried to add some to make the application more user-friendly. Let's see these features:

-   Integration of **flight-microframework** - which is extremely light weight. To learn it's features, simply go to this `Weblink <http://flightphp.com/learn/>`_
-   A **Model-View-Controller** like system architecture `::view doc:: <system_architecture.rst>`_
-   **Single Configuration** file with Config class
-   **Hooks** for client request and response validation
-   MySQL database connection support with **PDO driver**
-   **System** classes to retain application integrity: Core Controller, Model, Exception, Cache, Log, Security
-   **Helper** classes: Array, Date, Common utility
-   **Console** and unit testing (with PHPunit library)
